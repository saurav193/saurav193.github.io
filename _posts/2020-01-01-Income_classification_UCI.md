title: Income Classification among US adults
---
* Analyzed to determine the factors which affected the income of US adults to be either greater than or less than $50 K.
* Observed the most important features differed according to the algorithms used â€“ SVM, Adaboost or Random Forest. Implemented Adaboost was based on the accuracy metric.
* Created a Dockerfile to make the project pipeline reproducible and easily shareable. The repo can be  found [here](https://github.com/saurav193/Income_level_predictor)
