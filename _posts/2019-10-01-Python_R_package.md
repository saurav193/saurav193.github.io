title: Building Python and R packages
---

### Brief

* Built a package python and R package for clustering unsupervised data and validating the goodness of fit using Kmeans.
* This package can be used to apply Kmeans clustering algorithm in unsupervised learning problems. Works very similar to the existing Kmeans package but not as robust as they are. Useful for learning simple package development with continuous integration.
* The python package can be found [here](https://github.com/saurav193/Kmeans_python) and R package [here](https://github.com/saurav193/KmeansR)
