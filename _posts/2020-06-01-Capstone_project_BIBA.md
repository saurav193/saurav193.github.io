* Processed and analyzed large datasets with advanced feature engineering techniques like PCA, RFE, etc.
* Developed robust machine learning models using python sklearn library to predict the number of sessions in a playground per month
* Explored customized models using combinations of off-the-shelf algorithms like xgboost, lightgbm, random forest to get a better fit.
* Built efficient data analysis and prediction pipelines and made the work completely reproducible. The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/saurav193/capstone_BIBA)
