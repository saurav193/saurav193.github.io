title: The beauty of Vancouver
---

I have been to Vancouver for just over a 2 weeks and already in love with this city. Being from India which is crowded, hot and humid it has been a drastic change in my lifestyle coming to Canada. There are a lot of greenery all around the city. The people are nice and the weather was really wonderful in the first week until it started raining. The only "thing" about this city is that it rains a lot and the rains are incessant and you need to cary your umbrella almost everytime you go out. Apart from the rains the city full of landscapes and natural treasures all around like - 
* Jericho Beach
* Kits Beach
* Stanley Park
* Pacific Spirit park
* Grouse Mountain
* Capiliano suspension bridge
etc.

There is a lot to explore all around and I am going a write about my trips to all the places around. Stay tuned !!
